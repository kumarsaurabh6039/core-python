# Basic Level
# Print Numbers
# Write a program to print numbers from 1 to 10 using a while loop.
# number = 0
# while number<10:
#     # print("number")
#     print(number)
#     number+=1

# Sum of Numbers
# Write a program to calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to n (user input) using a while loop.
# num = 0
# num1= int(input("enter first number: "))
# num2= int(input("enter second number: "))
# while num<2:
#     print(num1*num2)
#     num+=1
    
    
    

# Even Numbers
# Write a program to print all even numbers between 1 and 50 using a while loop.
# i = 1
# while i <= 50:
#     if i % 2 == 0:
#         print(i)
#         i+=1
# i = 1
# while i <= 50:
#     if i % 2 == 0:
#         print(i)
#     i += 1

# Reverse Countdown
# Write a program to print numbers in reverse order from 10 to 1 using a while loop.
# i = 10
# while i >= 1:
#     print(i)
#     i -= 1
# Factorial of a Number
# Write a program to calculate the factorial of a number entered by the user using a while loop.
# n = int(input("Enter a number: "))
# factorial = 1
# while n > 0:
#     factorial *= n
#     n -= 1
# print("Factorial:", factorial)

# Intermediate Level
# Guess the Number
# Create a number guessing game. The program generates a random number between 1 and 100. The user keeps guessing until they find the correct number.

# Sum of Digits
# Write a program to find the sum of the digits of a number entered by the user using a while loop.
# num = 0
# num1= int(input("enter first number: "))
# num2= int(input("enter second number: "))
# while num<1:
#     print(num1+num2)
#     num+=1
num= int(input("enter  number: "))
num=0
while num<1:
    
    
# Palindrome Number
# Check if a number entered by the user is a palindrome (reads the same forward and backward) using a while loop.

# Multiplication Table
# Write a program to print the multiplication table of a number entered by the user using a while loop.

# Count Digits
# Write a program to count the number of digits in a number entered by the user using a while loop.

# Advanced Level
# Fibonacci Series
# Generate the first n terms of the Fibonacci series using a while loop. (e.g., 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, ...)

# Collatz Conjecture
# For a given number n, repeatedly apply the following rule until n becomes 1:

# If n is even, divide it by 2.
# If n is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1. Display the sequence of numbers.
# Prime Number Check
# Write a program to check if a number is prime using a while loop.

# Reverse a Number
# Reverse a number entered by the user using a while loop (e.g., 123 becomes 321).

# Pattern Printing
# Use a while loop to print a pattern like:

# markdown
# Copy code
# *
# **
# ***
# ****
# *****    
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
#    #  take a string Apple is good
   
 str1= 'Apple is good'
vowel = "A,E,I,O,U"
count=0
set = []
while count <len(str1):
    if str1[count].upper() in vowel:
        
        print(str1[count],end='<->')
        print[set]
    else:
        pass
